This case study of the Washington D.C Bike Sharing System aims to predict the total number of users on an hourly basis. The dataset is [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset/home). It contains usage information of years 2011 and 2012.

All the files of this project are saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashomah/Bike-Sharing-in-Washington-DC).

### Kaggle API Credentials
The data is directly downloaded from the Kaggle competition using the Kaggle API. You would need to set up your Kaggle API credentials by following [these instructions](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api):  
> 1. To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com.  
> 2. Then go to the `Account` tab of your user profile (`https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account`) and select `Create API Token`. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials.  
> 3. Place this file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (on macOS).  
> 4. For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not have read access to your credentials. On Unix-based systems you can do this with the following command: `chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.
